      <!-- <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        We are looking to build resilient farming communities in the Horn of Affrica by helping local farmers learn ways they can adapt to water scarcity caused by climate change.
        <br>
        <br>
        Climate change is already making it harder for people to feed themselves. From 2003 to 2013, climate-related economic losses stemming from decreased crop and livestock production exceeded $80 billion. The problem is especially severe in sub-Saharan Africa, where 95 percent of the food grown depends on rain. The World Bank anticipates that by 2030, climate-related impacts on agriculture will push an additional 100 million people into poverty.

      <h1>Resources</h1>
      <h2>Resilient agriculture - Contemporary farming methods mixed with agroecology and novel farming technology</h2>
      <p>
        Climate resilient agriculture is able to survive and thrive over shocks and disturbances caused by climate change, such as severe storms, heat waves and droughts. Without resilience farmers risk losing their crops, livestock and their livelihood For smallholder farmers, these shocks can exhaust scarce resources of cash, seeds and livestock.
      </p>
      <h2>Agriculture technology</h2>
      <p>
        We share information on contemporary technologies available for agriculture. These technologies include farmland irrigation, water capture and storage, hydroponics and renewable energy for agriculture and domestic use. We can help local farmers to acquire and finance farming technologies by providing contacts and funding.
      </p>
      <h2>Education for farmers</h2>
      <p>
        Training in improved agronomy practices. Education in basic ecology and hydrological cycle help farmers to understand how their farming environment functions. Crop diversification increases crop resiliency. Composting and nutrient recycling. Focus on farming vegetables, animal husbandry included only when it’s conditions permit and it would bring benefits in nutrition and crop rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assistance incorporating nutrition considerations into crop selection. Help Identify ways to reduce food loss and generate off-farm income. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Help farmers to find local markets to get their products sold. Teach how foodstuff markets work. Importance of diversifying production and income streams in order to reduce reliance on any one crop.
